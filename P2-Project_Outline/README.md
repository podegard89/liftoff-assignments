## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We are planning to build a web app called "ToDyeFor." It's geared toward people interested in dyeing fabric. It will be a one stop shop for saving, sharing, and calculating 
dye recipes. Users will be able to search through a catalog of dye recipes that all users of the site can contribute to, or calculate a recipte for their dye project
using the site's dye recipe calculator if they can't already find what they need. Once calculated, they can choose to create an account to save their recipe, and can then
share their recipe publicly with other users if they so wish. The site would prove to be very useful for hobbyists looking to search through or calculate recipes all in one place, but 
also for experienced artists looking to keep track of their own recipes and build up community among fabric artists through the sharing of their recipes. 
### Features
Features:
-User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
-Search: Users will be able to search through shared dye recipes created by other users
-Create recipes: Users will be able to create recipes while logged in. Recipes can be made viewable on one's profile page.
-Calculate recipes: Users will be able to calculate recipes using the dye recipe calculator. Available to users who don't have an account.
	Sub feature: users with accounts can choose to save calculated recipes to their profile
-Share recipes: Users who choose to make their recipes viewable will have their recipes integrated into the search feature
